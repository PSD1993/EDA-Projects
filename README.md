📌 Conclusion: Amazon Prime Video – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This exploratory data analysis on Amazon Prime Video content reveals several key insights about the type, popularity, ratings, and characteristics of shows and movies available on the platform.

🎥 Content Type Distribution:
The platform is heavily dominated by Movies (~94%), with Shows making up only a small fraction (~6%).

This suggests Amazon Prime focuses more on one-time content consumption rather than episodic or seasonal content.

⭐ IMDB Score Distribution:
TV Shows tend to have higher and more consistent IMDB scores compared to Movies.

Movies show a wider variation in quality, with scores ranging from very low to very high.

TV Shows generally cluster around the 7.5–8.0 range, indicating better average user reception.

📈 Correlation Analysis:
A strong positive correlation exists between imdb_score and tmdb_score (0.62), indicating consistency across platforms.

imdb_votes and tmdb_popularity are moderately correlated (~0.24), suggesting that more votes often reflect higher popularity.

A negative correlation between runtime and seasons (-0.30) confirms that longer content tends to be movies, whereas shows have more seasons but shorter episodes.

release_year has very little correlation with popularity or score — meaning newer content is not necessarily better rated.

🎯 Overall Takeaways:
Amazon Prime Video offers a wide range of content, but it is movie-centric.

TV Shows, although fewer, maintain higher user satisfaction based on ratings.

Popularity and ratings are moderately linked, but not always directly proportional.

The platform's content exhibits diverse quality, especially among movies.
